I would like to do dithering.

Hur gör jag dithering för icke monokroma värden?

Framerate counter, Easy math. Done
user controlled camera, we have that. Done
Read shaders and textures from disk, we have this. Done
Four or more objects, trivial. Done with the easy ones.
Phong reflections, new. Done
Directional light, I think we have this, but it needs heavy reworking. Done
Our directional light needs to be able to change direction. And colour. Done
What is normal mapping? Done

NOTE: Rewrite normal mapping and phong to be less stealing
for the normal mapp do cross product with glm::cross https://youtu.be/0QhR7WSoF78?t=153

What is shadow mapping? Wikipedia shadow mapping CSSM
How to post-process using framebuffer?
Animation should be doable.
What is Signed distance field? Weird blurry fonts

Note: steal everything you can

program
vbuffer
vformat
sampler
